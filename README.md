# MiniEtherBank
This smart contract implements a decentralized Ether banking system with core financial functionalities. The deposit function allows users to securely add Ether to their personal bank account within the contract by simply sending Ether along with the transaction, which automatically updates their balance and emits a deposit event for transparency. For withdrawals, users can specify any recipient address and amount, with the system automatically verifying both their personal balance sufficiency and the contract's overall Ether availability before executing the transfer and deducting the amount from their account.

The internal transfer feature enables seamless fund movements between users within the banking system without requiring actual blockchain transactions, functioning as an internal accounting mechanism that adjusts balances between sender and recipient while maintaining a complete audit trail. Users can conveniently check their personal balance at any time through a simple view function call, and additionally monitor the contract's overall financial health by querying its total Ether balance, providing full visibility into both individual and system-wide financial positions. Together, these functionalities create a comprehensive banking experience where users have complete control over their funds while maintaining security and transparency throughout all financial operations.
